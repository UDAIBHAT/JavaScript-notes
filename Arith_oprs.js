    //         There are different types of JavaScript operators:

    
    //  Arithmetic Operators
    //     Assignment Operators
    //         Comparison Operators
    //             String Operators
    //                 Logical Operators
    //                     Bitwise Operators
    //                         Ternary Operators
    //                             Type Operators



let value = 3
let negValue = -value
// console.log(negValue);

// console.log(2+2);
// console.log(2-2);
// console.log(2*2);
// console.log(2**3); exponentiation

// [Incrementing]
// The increment operator (++) increments numbers.

let x = 5;
x++;
console.log(x);

// [Decrementing]
// The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers.

// Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.

//             let x = 100 + 50 * 3;

// Is the result of example above the same as 150 * 3, or is it the same as 100 + 150?

// Is the addition or the multiplication done first?

// As in traditional school mathematics, the multiplication is done first.

// Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

// And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses.

// When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first:


//             let x = (100 + 50) * 3;


// When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction or multiplication and division), they are computed from left to right:
